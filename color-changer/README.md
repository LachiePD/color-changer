THis is a prototype for a color picker.

It can be placed into the 'prototype' folder.

Needs a lot of scrub.

Can currently select each block, the trigger a color change with the button in the top right hand corner.


Needs to have more reactivity to things being clicked on such as block selection or the button being triggered.
